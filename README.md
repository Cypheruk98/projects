**Python converter:**
Through an IoT device, volume measurements for a container was measured and readings were transmitted in a hexidecimal format, with up to 100+ individual hex codes sent per reading. For our analytics team I was tasked to create a converter in python to read and store these readings in decimal format and in a csv file.
